# Lesson 5 & 6 - PostgreSQL (Student) Part 2

## PostgreSQL Commands
- SELECT * FROM <table_name> WHERE <column_> <condition_> <pattern_>; -
  - Pattern conditions
    - LIKE - Pattern matching
    - ILIKE - Pattern matching but ignore case
    - NOT LIKE - Pattern ignoring
    - NOT ILIKE - Pattern ignoring but ignore case
      - % - Wild card match
      - _ - Match a single space
    - IS NULL - Check whether value is null
    - IS NOT NULL - Check whether value is not null
- SELECT * FROM <table_name> ORDER BY <column_1> <order_1>, <column_2> <order_2>, .... <column_n> <order_n> -
  - Order conditions
    - ASC - Ascending
    - DESC - Descending
- SELECT <round_off_condition>(<condition_>(<column_>), <decimal_places>) FROM <table_name>; - Use the condition to find a specific value from a column of the table
  - Column conditions
    - MIN - Find the minimum value from the column
    - MAX - Find the maximum value from the column
    - SUM - Find the sum of all the values in the column
    - AVG - Find the average value of all the values in the column
    - COUNT - Count the values in the column
    - DISTINCT - Show the distinct values in the column, same effect can be achieved by GROUP BY
  - Round off conditions (conditional conditions)
    - CEIL - Round of the value to the upper ceiling value
    - FLOOR - Round of the value to the lower floor value
    - ROUND - Round of the value to the closes whole number value
- SELECT <column_1>, <condition_1>(<column_>), <condition_2>(<column_>) FROM <table> GROUP BY <column_1> HAVING <condition_having>; - Select values from a column grouped by column_1 and satisfying the condition <condition_having>
- SELECT <column_name> AS <new_name> FROM <table_name>; - Show data from column and use a new name
- SELECT <column_name> FROM <table_name> <join_condition> ON <table_name> <foreign_key>; -
  - Join conditions
    - FULL JOIN - All connections
    - LEFT JOIN - All connections from left side
    - RIGHT JOIN - All connections from right side
    - INNER JOIN - Not null connections
  - Can skip <foreign_key> comparison by using USING(<foreign_key_column>), this converts them into 1 column instead of two seperate columns
